          <p>Hi, I'm Nikos!</p>
          <p>i'm a fullstack web developer and a Software engineering student  at Thinkful based in Silver Spring Maryland. As an avid learner, I enjoy coding because it constantly challenges me to expand my skills and knowledge.</p>

<p>With a background in marketing and ITC, over the years I have developed an understanding of ingenuity and human behavior with regards to design. Effective design can invoke desired behavior, convey specific messages, and influence a visitorâ€™s movement pattern. As I build websites, I am always thinking of ways to merge functionality and messaging into an effective design.</p>

          <p>
            As Business graduate I first got exposed to web development and graphics design at an entertainment company I worked in. Being around artists of all kinds in a very creative environment, I picked up a knack for web development as part of the marketing efforts.  
          </p>
          <p>
           I have since then, engaged these skills through collaborations that have helped me deepen my understanding and passion for web development and teamwork. I went as far as learning to host websites and other technologies as an IT technician.   
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy meeting and collaborating with others because I believe there is no better way to grow professionally and as a person.
